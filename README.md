Just the source code for the Social Notifier Discord Bot for AceOfCreation's Discord Server.

Do whatever you want with it but don't expect it to be super advaced with multiple channels because i made it specifically for AceOfCreation's youtube channel.

Latest change log:
1. Fixed memory leak
2. Added playlist filter (it didn't filter playlists which caused weird 
behavior)
3. Added extra logging and unnecessary necessary overlapping prevention and some other things i already forgot lol.

I know it tries to save 3 video ids while it only receives 1 from the api call but i'm not gonna touch it because it works.
